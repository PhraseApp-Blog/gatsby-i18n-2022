# Companion app to Phrase blog article

This demo app was created along with a Phrase blog article.

## Installation

1. Ensure that you have the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime on
   your dev machine
1. Ensure that you have the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-cli/#how-to-use-gatsby-cli)
   installed on your dev machine
1. Navigate to the project root.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `gatsby develop` to launch the app and start developing

### Using with the Phrase ICE

If you're using the Phrase In-Context Editor with this demo (which is optional),
make sure to:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.development` and update the latter by adding
   your actual project ID
2. If you want to use the Phrase ICE in production builds, repeat step 1. and
   create an `.env.production` file as well

> ⚠️ You probably want to add your .env\* files to your .gitignore for security
