Fitzgerald began the novel in 1925 after the publication of his third novel
_The Great Gatsby_. During the protracted writing process, the mental health of
his wife Zelda Fitzgerald deteriorated, and she required extended
hospitalization due to her suicidal and homicidal tendencies. After her
hospitalization in Baltimore, Maryland, the author rented the La Paix estate
in the suburb of Towson to be close to his wife, and he continued working on
the manuscript. — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tender_Is_the_Night)
