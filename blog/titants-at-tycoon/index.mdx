In 1993, a new version of the novel was published under the title
_The Love of the Last Tycoon_, edited by Matthew Bruccoli, a Fitzgerald
scholar. This version was adapted for a stage production that premiered in
Los Angeles, California in 1998. In 2013, HBO announced plans to produce an
adaptation. HBO cancelled the project and gave the rights to Sony Pictures,
which produced and released the television series on Amazon Studios in 2016. —
